# What to Learn Next

Ok, I guess you’re all fired up to learn more right now - it’s exciting when you start discovering new things!

So, here's a short and sweet guideline on what to learn next. Also, as a valued student, I've got some awesome extra discounts for my other courses - as a thank you gift.

You've mastered JavaScript. Now, you should choose between front-end or back-end development. 

Front-end development is about building the front of an application: in other words - what the user sees and interacts with. All the mobile apps and websites we work with have a back-end that is hidden from us. The back-end receives or returns data to the client. It's typically an application sitting on a web server listening for HTTP requests. A developer who knows both front and back-end development is called a full-stack developer. Full-stack developers earn more because they have more skills and are more useful to employers.

## Front-end Development

There are many different libraries and frameworks for building front-ends.[ ](https://codewithmosh.com/p/mastering-react/)[React](https://codewithmosh.com/p/mastering-react/),[ ](https://codewithmosh.com/p/angular-master-class)[Angular](https://codewithmosh.com/p/angular-master-class) and Vue are the top three. Out of the three, React is the easiest to learn. So, I'd recommend you start there.
