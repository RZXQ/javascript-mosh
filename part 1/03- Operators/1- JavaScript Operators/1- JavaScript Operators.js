// Five types of operators in JavaScript:
// 1. Arithmetic   (+, -, *, /, % etc.)
// 2. Assignment   (=, +=, -= etc.)
// 3. Comparison   (==, !=, ===, !==, <, > etc.)
// 4. Logical      (&&, ||, !)
// 5. Bitwise      (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)

// Definitions:
// Operand:    Value operated on by an operator (e.g., in b + c, "b" and "c" are operands).
// Operator:   Symbol performing operations on operands (e.g., "+" in b + c).
// Expression: Combination of operands and operators evaluated to produce a value (e.g., b + c).
// Statement:  Line of executable code performing actions (e.g., const a = b + c;).
