let x = 1;

// Relational operators
console.log(x > 0); // true (x is greater than 0)
console.log(x >= 1); // true (x is greater than or equal to 1)
console.log(x < 1); // false (x is not less than 1)
console.log(x <= 1); // true (x is less than or equal to 1)

// Equality operators
console.log(x == "1"); // true (loose equality, checks value only)
console.log(x === 1); // true (strict equality, checks value and type)
console.log(x !== 1); // false (x is equal to 1, so this is false)
