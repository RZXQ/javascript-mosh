Why React mixes JavaScript and HTML together (JSX) despite traditional separation of concerns:

1. Understanding separation of concerns (SoC):

Traditionally, web developers considered separation of concerns as clearly separating JavaScript (logic), HTML (markup), and CSS (styling). Each technology focuses on a specific job:
- HTML: structure/content
- CSS: visual style/presentation
- JavaScript: interaction/behavior

This approach aimed at better maintainability and clarity.

2. Why does React mix HTML and JavaScript using JSX?

React uses components that combine HTML-like markup and JavaScript. Although this initially seems to go against separation of concerns, React redefines the concept by focusing on functional concerns rather than technology type separation.
React shifts perspective from traditional technology separation (HTML vs JS vs CSS), instead focusing on functional encapsulation and modularity.

3. Advantages of React JSX-style components:

a. Easier mental model Developers reason about the interface in terms of clear, self-contained units (components), combining rendering logic and related behavior.
b. Improved reusability and maintainability Components are encapsulated units containing all necessary markup and logic, making them reusable and maintainable.
c. Less cognitive overhead Logic and markup together are easier to read, understand, debug, and maintain, especially as projects grow larger.
d. Declarative programming model JSX’s declarative nature clearly communicates how UI should look and behave, helping readability significantly.
1. Does React entirely abandon traditional separation of concerns?

No, React does not abandon the idea but reinterprets it, promoting functional encapsulation rather than technology separation.
- Components encapsulate markup and related interaction logic, as those closely belong together.
- Styles often remain separate (CSS Modules or styled-components), testing logic and data management also can be separated into isolated files/functions.

4. Choosing which approach to follow:

- Traditional separation (HTML/JS/CSS): Good for smaller, simpler projects or static websites without extensive interactive features.
- React’s component-based approach: Ideal for large applications or dynamic front-ends where complexity grows, enhancing scalability and maintainability.

Summary:
- Traditional "Separation of Concerns": separated by technology (HTML/JS/CSS).
- React’s "Separation of Concerns": separated by functionality (logical units called components).

Both approaches are valuable, each solving different types of problems. React intentionally redefines separation of concerns to achieve clear, logical functional encapsulation and easier maintainability.
