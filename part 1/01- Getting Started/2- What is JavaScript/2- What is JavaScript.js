// 1. Node.js was created by embedding Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine with C++. This combination enables JavaScript to run outside the browser.
//    Node generally consists of the V8 engine (for JS execution), libuv (for handling async I/O), and various built-in modules for filesystem, HTTP, etc.

// 2. JavaScript can run in two main environments: in a web browser (using the browser's JS engine) or in Node.js (a runtime that allows JS to run server-side).
