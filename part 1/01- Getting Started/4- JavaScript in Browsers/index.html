  Reasons to place JavaScript at the bottom of the body tag:

  1. Performance:
     Placing scripts in the head causes browsers to pause parsing HTML
     while downloading and executing JavaScript code. This delay can
     prevent the page from rendering quickly, potentially showing users
     a blank or partially loaded page.

  2. Dependency on DOM Elements:
     JavaScript frequently interacts with webpage elements (like
     manipulating or updating content). By positioning scripts at the
     end of the body, we ensure that all HTML elements are completely
     loaded and ready for manipulation.
