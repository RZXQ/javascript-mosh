    <!-- Explanation:
     1. The browser loads HTML content sequentially from top to bottom.
        If the JavaScript script is placed at the top, it might interrupt the rendering process
        of the rest of the HTML. For example, scripts that access or interact with other elements
        would fail if those elements havenâ€™t been rendered yet.
     2. To ensure all HTML elements are correctly rendered before scripts are executed,
        it is best practice to place JavaScript code at the bottom of the <body>. -->

    <script>
      // This is my first JavaScript code!
      console.log("Hello World");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
